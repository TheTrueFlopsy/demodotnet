Hypothesis: To have overlapping instances in any target string H (haystack), a sought string N (needle) must consist of at least two repetitions of a prefix, the last of which may be partial. An overlapping instance occurs iff an instance occurs at H[i] and another instance occurs at H[i+d], for some d in [1, len(N)). This means that for all j in [0, len(N)-d), N[j] = N[d+j], which is equivalent to the hypothesis.

TODO: Write a proper proof of the above.

This means that there's no need to backtrack to find overlapping instances. Whenever an instance that was not preceded by overlapping instances has been found, we know that we have the beginning of an overlapping instance (i.e. the found instance minus the first repetition of the prefix). We may continue to check this partial hit in H against the suffix of N starting at len(N)-len(prefix).

TODO: Write a proper proof of the above.

The maximum number of instances overlapping with an instance of a string that consists of n repetitions of a prefix is 2*(n-1). This is true regardless of whether the last repetition is partial. Imagine lining up two instances vertically and then sliding one of them left or right by increments equal to the length of the (complete) repeated prefix.

TODO: Write a proper proof of the above.

TODO: Prove that all overlapping instances must start at a multiple of a single shortest repeated prefix length, i.e. it is not possible to separate a string into repetitions of two or more different prefixes, where neither is a multiple of the other or any shorter repeated prefix.

ISSUE: Since the repeated prefix is an arbitrary string, this kind of structure (rep. prefix has a rep. prefix which has a ...) can be arbitrarily deep. What does that mean for any attempt to "intelligently" handle restart after failed partial match? Deal with the highest level of prefixing that you've proceeded into? How do you keep track of all the prefix levels? Is all this even worth it for what is a corner case in the first place?

IDEA: Turn the problem inside out. Build the search algorithm around the repeated prefix structure and make strings with repeat count 1 the "corner case".

ISSUE: Can all this match restart bothersomeness be neatly integrated with overlapping instance search? Repeating prefixes are central there, too.

IDEA: Is it always sufficient to continue the match with the unmatching character, now at position pos-|P| in N, unless pos-|P| is not in the repeating-prefix part of N (then start at position 0)?


NOTE: I need to distinguish two different concepts that are both in some sense about a "repeating prefix". The first is simply some prefix of the string reappearing later in the string (i.e. N > 0 chars starting at I > 0 are equal to the first N chars of the string). The second is a special case of the first, some prefix of the string being consecutively repeated at least twice at the start of the string (i.e. the first N > 0 chars of the string are equal to the N chars starting at I = k*N for all k in [1, K] for some K > 0). An extension of the second case allows the last repetition to be partial (i.e. end after less than N (but at least one) repeated chars).
	! The first sense is relevant to restarting after a failed partial match.
	! The extended second sense (specifically, strings that consist entirely of such a repeated prefix) is relevant to finding overlapping matches.
